Created on 3/3/2020 as homework for my Intro to Computer Programming class.

This is a python program text adventure walking you through the first day in the world of Minceraft. Built in Python 3.8.1

This is the largest program I've made in python yet, and python is super fun to write in! It's funny how similar everything is to JavaScript :)
