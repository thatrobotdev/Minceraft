# Minceraft

## Problem Set Prompt
```python3
# Ask the user at least three questions and store their answers in variables
# For example: age = input ("How old are you: ")
#              color = input ("What is your favorite color? ")
#
# Use if-elif-else statements to draw some conclusions
# For example: if age > 14 and color == "red":
#                 print ("You are Birthday Cake! You like...")

Created on 3/3/2020 as homework for my Intro to Computer Programming class.

This is a python program text adventure walking you through the first day in the world of Minceraft. Built in Python 3.8.1

This is the largest program I've made in python yet, and python is super fun to write in! It's funny how similar everything is to JavaScript :)
